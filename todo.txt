NOTES:

    -frontend:
	    -vuejs 

    -backend:
	    -firebase
	    -write my own?
		    -node.js?
		    -flask?

    -theme?
	    -starship simulator?
	    -financial sim?
	    -office sim? like gamedevstory?

TODO:
-create character blocks
	-cost to hire or recurring cost?
		-cost to hire is easier / faster
	-random selection or can choose from set?
		-random is easier / faster
	-use some fontawesome icons with unique color so it's easier to differentiate?


-starting char can do all jobs
-other chars are single class or two
-can train chars to be better

-'timer' events can be good or bad

-set up random jobs using defined method from JSON sets
	-track job by name but not type as it flows through the workflow
		-after planning, the job is split into some number of subtasks
		-coding works on those; same number pass through to testing
		-testing has a random chance to send back one or more bugs which appear in planning again...
			-higher challenge rating means higher likelyhood of bugs etc, but also means higher payout

-populate new staff into the 'TODO' column so player can choose staff chars to hire (need to show cost)
	-can happen after you get funds or on a schedule?
-create a set of turn based events (quarters are good; trade show; sales events; mergers etc)
	-get some result when reaching a milestone?
-create a set of random events as well ('weal or woe')
-expand the office; increase the number of seats available
-items to buy to allow for improving staff (training, and equipment)

-add init phase to game to kick off the initial state
-add funds when project parts are completed
-highlite card click and unset on fail


DESIGN:
-office sim
	-use a kanban style interface
	-have several different chars that have different skills
		-BA
		-Coder
		-Tester
	-get jobs; and earn money for completion.
	-timer for events (maybe x number of turns before events)
		-trade show
		-holiday
		-new tech



DONE:
-scaffold a vue project with SCSS, Typescript and UT
-make this file
-learn some Typescript -- perhaps I'll use the fancy form idea from above for that...
    -inspired by: https://github.com/muhammederdem/vue-interactive-paycard
-scaffold *ANOTHER* vue project with SCSS, Typescript and UT
-figure out what I will actually build
-add FontAwesome icons
-small progress bar component to use in many places!
